## 🎨 Wireframes

**Wireframes** are simple sketches of a website - like a blueprint for a house. They show:

- Where things go (buttons, text, images)
- How pages connect
- What the website will do

**Why we use them:**
- Plan the layout quickly
- Easy to make changes
- Everyone understands the plan

**What it is:** How users move between pages
**Example:** Menu bar, back buttons, breadcrumbs

## 🎯 Our Wireframe Approach

For this AirBnB clone project, we started with **low-fidelity wireframes** to quickly plan the basic layout and user flow. Then we created **high-fidelity wireframes** to finalize the details before starting development.

**Our process:**
1. Low-fidelity sketches → Rapid planning and changes
2. High-fidelity wireframes → Detailed design decisions
3. Development → Building the actual website
