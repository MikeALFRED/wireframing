## 🎨 Wireframes

**Wireframes** are simple sketches of a website - like a blueprint for a house. They show:

- Where things go (buttons, text, images)
- How pages connect
- What the website will do

**Why we use them:**
- Plan the layout quickly
- Easy to make changes
- Everyone understands the plan

## 📋 Wireframe Elements

### 1. Layout Structure
**What it is:** How the page is organized into sections
**Example:** Header on top, search bar below, property grid in middle
**Why it matters:** Creates a clean, easy-to-use layout

### 2. Navigation  
**What it is:** How users move between pages
**Example:** Menu bar, back buttons, breadcrumbs
**Why it matters:** Helps users find what they need quickly

### 3. Content Placement
**What it is:** Where text, images, and information appear
**Example:** Property photos at top, details below, booking box on side
**Why it matters:** Shows most important information first

### 4. Functionality
**What it is:** What users can do on each page
**Example:** Search filters, date pickers, booking buttons
**Why it matters:** Makes the website interactive and useful


## 📊 Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
**What they look like:**
- Simple black and white sketches
- Basic shapes and lines
- Placeholder text (like "lorem ipsum")
- No colors or real images

**When we use them:**
- Early brainstorming sessions
- Quick idea testing
- Getting initial feedback
- Planning basic layout

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
**What they look like:**
- More detailed and polished
- Actual content and text
- Specific colors and fonts
- Real button styles and form fields

**When we use them:**
- Final design approval
- Developer handoff
- Detailed user testing
- Client presentations

## 🎯 Our Wireframe Approach

For this AirBnB clone project, we started with **low-fidelity wireframes** to quickly plan the basic layout and user flow. Then we created **high-fidelity wireframes** to finalize the details before starting development.

**Our process:**
1. Low-fidelity sketches → Rapid planning and changes
2. High-fidelity wireframes → Detailed design decisions
3. Development → Building the actual website

## 🛠️ Wireframing Tools

### Popular Tools

**Figma** - Our recommended choice
**Adobe XD** - Good for Adobe users
**Sketch** - Popular with Mac users
**Balsamiq** - Great for quick low-fidelity wireframes
**Pen and Paper** - Fastest for initial ideas

### Why We Chose Figma

**Figma** is our go-to tool for wireframing because:

**✅ Free to use** - No cost for basic features
**✅ Works in browser** - No installation needed
**✅ Real-time collaboration** - Team can work together
**✅ Easy sharing** - Simple link sharing for feedback
**✅ Design to code** - Developers can inspect elements
**✅ Component library** - Reuse common elements

**Key Figma Features:**
- Drag and drop interface
- Pre-made UI kits
- Interactive prototypes
- Comment system for feedback
- Version history
- Mobile preview

## 💡 Development Benefits

### How Wireframes Help Build Better Software

**Clear Technical Requirements**
- Developers see exactly what to build
- Understand user interactions needed
- Plan component structure early

**Example:** Our property booking wireframe showed exactly how the date picker should work, helping developers choose the right calendar library.

**Faster Development**
- Less back-and-forth between designers and developers
- Fewer design changes during coding
- Clear roadmap for implementation

**Better Team Communication**
- Designers, developers, and clients all see the same vision
- Specific feedback on functionality, not just aesthetics
- Everyone understands user flows

**Example:** Using Figma, our team could comment directly on the search filter wireframe to discuss technical feasibility.

**Cost Effective**
- Fix layout problems before coding begins
- Reduce expensive redesigns later
- Streamline the entire development process

**Improved User Experience**
- Focus on usability before visual design
- Test navigation paths early
- Ensure logical information hierarchy

**Example:** Our wireframes revealed that users needed quicker access to price filters, so we moved them to a more prominent position.
