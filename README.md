## 🎨 Wireframes

**Wireframes** are simple sketches of a website - like a blueprint for a house. They show:

- Where things go (buttons, text, images)
- How pages connect
- What the website will do

**Why we use them:**
- Plan the layout quickly
- Easy to make changes
- Everyone understands the plan

## 📋 Wireframe Elements

### 1. Layout Structure
**What it is:** How the page is organized into sections
**Example:** Header on top, search bar below, property grid in middle
**Why it matters:** Creates a clean, easy-to-use layout

### 2. Navigation  
**What it is:** How users move between pages
**Example:** Menu bar, back buttons, breadcrumbs
**Why it matters:** Helps users find what they need quickly

### 3. Content Placement
**What it is:** Where text, images, and information appear
**Example:** Property photos at top, details below, booking box on side
**Why it matters:** Shows most important information first

### 4. Functionality
**What it is:** What users can do on each page
**Example:** Search filters, date pickers, booking buttons
**Why it matters:** Makes the website interactive and useful


## 📊 Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
**What they look like:**

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
**What they look like:**

**When we use them:**
- Final design approval
- Developer handoff
- Detailed user testing
- Client presentations

## 🎯 Our Wireframe Approach

For this AirBnB clone project, we started with **low-fidelity wireframes** to quickly plan the basic layout and user flow. Then we created **high-fidelity wireframes** to finalize the details before starting development.

**Our process:**
1. Low-fidelity sketches → Rapid planning and changes
2. High-fidelity wireframes → Detailed design decisions
3. Development → Building the actual website
