## 🎨 Wireframes

**Wireframes** are simple sketches of a website - like a blueprint for a house. They show:

- Where things go (buttons, text, images)
- How pages connect
- What the website will do

**Why we use them:**
- Plan the layout quickly
- Easy to make changes
- Everyone understands the plan
